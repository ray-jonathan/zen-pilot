    Hi! I’m Hélène. Gypsy pilot. With thousands of hours above the cloud lines of Africa, Europe and the Caribbean’s, I’d like to think I have picked up a thing or two about travelling and focusing on what is essential. My background is both in literature and aeronautics, but I am also passionate about poetry, meditation, yoga, wasting less, and minimalism. 
    <br>How can you curate a life that is meaningful to you and suppress the daily stressors and clutter? I can help.
