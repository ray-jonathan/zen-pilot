<p style="font-size: 6">The Challenge:</p>
<h2>Can I make my own CMS and kick Wordpress to the curb?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 6">
History: A friend has a blog that is managed through Wordpress and is getting kind of cumbersome with all the plugins it takes to create the style they want.
<br>
Goal: Recreate the site using just a stack of Node.js/Express and PostGreSQL.
<br>
Anticipated Challenges: Managing dozens-to-hundreds of images and other files, traditionally passed off to a CMS.
